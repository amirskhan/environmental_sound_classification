# Environmental Sound Classification using Deep Learning
This project is about classifying environment sounds using an appropraite deep learning algorithm. This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy. For a detailed description of the dataset and how it was compiled please refer to the paper(link is given below). And a CSV file containing metadata about each sound clip is also provided.

The whole project is distributed into 4 juyter notebooks, they are Data Pre-processing.ipynb, Model Training.ipynb, Evluation.ipynb, Inference.ipynb. Please refere to the notebooks for more details. The notebooks should be followed in the following order.

1. Data Pre-processing.ipynb
2. Model Training.ipynb
3. Evluation.ipynb
4. Inference.ipynb

## Dataset
Because of the huge size of the dataset it is not possible to include it in this repository. It can be downloaded from the link given below.
